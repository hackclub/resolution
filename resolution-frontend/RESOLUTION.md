# Resolution

**Bet on yourself. When others quit, their stakes become your reward.**

## What is Resolution?

Resolution is an 8-week goal-setting challenge where you stake real money on yourself and compete against your own limits. Pick your workshops, commit your time, and prove you can follow through. Those who finish win; those who quit fund the winners.

## How It Works

1. **Choose Your Workshops** — Pick up to 3 workshops based on your goals and availability (max one 3-star to prevent burnout)
2. **Stake Your Money** — Put skin in the game. Your stake is your commitment
3. **Complete Weekly Goals** — Each week you hit your targets, you unlock part of your stake
4. **Earn Weekly Prizes** — Stickers, exclusive rewards, and recognition for staying on track
5. **Claim Your Reward** — Finish strong and take home your stake plus a share of the pot from those who didn't make it

## The Economics

The magic happens because **not everyone finishes**.

- Stakes are calculated at **$5/hour** of committed time
- When someone quits or misses their goals, their remaining stake flows to those who stayed the course
- The fewer people who finish, the bigger the pot for winners
- This creates real incentive to keep going when things get tough

### Example
If 10 people join a Two Star workshop ($200 each = $2,000 pool) and only 6 finish:
- 4 quitters forfeit their remaining stakes
- Those funds get distributed to the 6 finishers
- Winners get their original stake back **plus** bonus rewards

## Weekly Prizes

The budget isn't all for the final prize—we allocate for weekly motivation:

- **Custom Stickers** — Dope art like Siege did
- **Milestone Rewards** — Recognition for hitting weekly targets
- **Progress Tracking** — Visual proof of your consistency

Without weekly incentives, there's no way to keep people going. The journey matters as much as the destination.

## Rules

1. You're competing against **yourself**, not others
2. Miss a week = forfeit that portion of your stake
3. Complete all 8 weeks = full stake returned + share of the pot
4. Max 3 workshops total
5. Max 1 three-star workshop (sanity protection)

## Why This Works

This isn't a subscription you forget about. It's not a course you never finish. It's a **bet on your future self** with real consequences and real rewards.

The model works because:
- **Skin in the game** — You've got money on the line
- **Weekly accountability** — Can't coast until the end
- **Shared stakes** — Others' failures become your gains
- **Community pressure** — You're not alone in this
