# Resolution

**A Hack Club program where you set goals, ship every week, and earn prizes for following through.**

## What is Resolution?

Resolution is an 8-week personal goal-setting challenge for teenage hackers. Pick workshops that align with what you want to learn or build, commit to a weekly time investment, and earn prizes for every week you follow through. Hack Club funds the prize pool — you just bring the dedication.

## How It Works

1. **RSVP & Choose Your Workshops** — Sign up and pick up to 3 workshops based on your goals (max one 3-star to keep it sustainable)
2. **Commit Your Time** — Each workshop tier has a weekly time commitment you agree to
3. **Ship Weekly** — Complete your weekly goals and show what you built
4. **Earn Weekly Prizes** — Get stickers, swag, and recognition for staying on track
5. **Finish Strong** — Complete all 8 weeks and claim your final reward from the prize pool

## The Prize Pool Economics

Here's where it gets interesting: **not everyone finishes**.

When someone drops out or misses their weekly goals, their allocated prize budget gets redistributed to those who stayed the course. The fewer people who make it to the end, the bigger the reward for those who do.

### Example
If 10 people join a Two Star workshop ($200 prize pool each = $2,000 total) and only 6 finish:
- The 4 who dropped = $800 redistributed
- The 6 finishers split the full $2,000 pool
- Each finisher gets more than their original $200 share

This creates real incentive to keep going when things get tough — and real reward for those who do.

## Weekly Prizes

The budget isn't all saved for the end. We allocate for weekly motivation:

- **Custom Stickers** — Dope art (like Siege!)
- **Milestone Recognition** — Shoutouts and badges for hitting weekly targets
- **Progress Tracking** — Visual proof of your consistency

Without weekly incentives, momentum dies. The journey matters as much as the destination.

## What Makes This Different

This isn't a course you forget about. It's not a tutorial you never finish. It's a **challenge with real stakes**:

- **Weekly accountability** — You can't coast until the end
- **Visible progress** — Ship something every week
- **Community** — You're not doing this alone
- **Real rewards** — Funded by Hack Club, earned by you
- **Dropout dynamics** — Others dropping out means more for you

## Inspired By

Resolution follows the Hack Club model of programs like:
- **Siege** — Ship a project every week, earn prizes, make it to the end and get a Framework laptop
- **High Seas** — Ship projects, earn doubloons, trade for prizes
- **Summer of Making** — Build all summer, earn gear and recognition

These programs prove that when you give teenagers real incentives and a community, incredible things get built.

  - Build consistent habits
